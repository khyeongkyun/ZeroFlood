# DONE: TerraMesh Quality Check
# 1. Check if TerrMesh center_lon and center_lat are within a boundary of LISFLOOD.
# 2. Check LULC Snow/Ice(7) and Clouds(8) percentages.
# 3. Check pixel (x,y) and center_lon and center_lat alignment.

# TODO: LISFLOOD Quality Check
# 1. Check spurious areas.

# TODO: TerraMesh and LISFLOOD Overlap Check
# 1. TerraMesh grid having LISFLOOD Permanent Water. (Threshold?)
# 2. TerraMesh grid having RP10 Flood Hazard. (Continuous/Discreat/Class?, Threshold?)
